== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What the hell is a conversion ? =

A website conversion is the most important factor to the success of your online marketing strategy and goals. It means getting your visitors to do what you want them to do, whether that is to buy your product, sign up for your newsletter, register for a webinar, download a whitepaper, or fill out a lead/contact form. [Here is the full article](https://www.boostsuite.com/2012/04/24/what-is-a-website-conversion/)

= Does this widget show only conversions ? =

Obviously not. Basically the Widget ( in the Free version ) loads the information from a column of your Spreadsheet and show it in the first row of a Popup and show a custom string in the second row of the popup. You can change the customer name for the titles of your last released products or published articles and the widget will show them in an animated popup.

= What do I need to use this Widget ? =

Basically you need a Google Spreadsheet like [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zPg5Z1P3hrCETxtt3sANAhbKa7RozxF47d9Q_4s3Trw/edit#gid=0). For the FREE Version you just need a column with the customer's name and a column with the email address (to load their Gravatars).

= My Google Spreadsheet need to be public ? =

No. You only need to share the Spreadsheet in the "Anyone with the link can view" mode ( take a look to the second Screenshot )

= How can I populate my Google Spreadsheet with my conversions details ? =

You can populate your Spreadsheet by hand or use one of the many existing services of automation like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/google-sheets/integrations)

= Can I show the conversions of a web site on an another web site ? =

Yes. You can show whatever you want wherever you want..you just need a Google Spreadsheet

= Can I hide the customer names and their Gravatars? =

Yes but not with the Free Version. Buying the [Pro Version](https://www.fuertedev.com/cpw/) you'll be able to hide the names with a custom string ( e.g.: 'A new Customer' ) and substitute the Gravatar image with a custom Image ( your Logo?! ).
